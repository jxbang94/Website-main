                        <p>Genshin Impact, an RPG (role-playing game) that has significantly influenced the gaming
                            industry, continues to captivate players worldwide. Garnering numerous awards, it has become
                            a catalyst for bringing diverse communities together. The game brings both joy and
                            frustration among players, who invest not only considerable time but also substantial
                            financial resources. The impact extends beyond individual players, affecting those in their
                            social circles as well.</p>

                            <p>Primarily popular among teenagers, Genshin Impact has faced criticism from parents
                                worldwide. One story features a Singaporean father with a $20,000 credit card debt
                                incurred by his daughter's in-game purchases. Another extreme case is <a

                                    player spending over $100,000 in the game</a> for receiving in game content. The
                                game's design encourages users to
                                invest both time and money to accelerate upgrades, progression, and advancement. This
                                dynamic can lead to addiction, with players finding it challenging to discern when to
                                pause, as the thrill of advancing in the game fuels a relentless desire to continue. To
